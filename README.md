# Setting Up a Shared Network Drive: A Comprehensive Guide for IT Beginners

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on setting up a shared network drive, designed with IT beginners in mind. This tutorial is provided free of charge, aiming to support those starting their journey in the IT field. We believe in empowering our community by sharing knowledge that is essential for your career growth. Let’s dive into the process, ensuring you have all the tools and information needed to successfully create and manage a shared network drive.

## Preparatory Steps

### Checking Server Drive Space

Before we start, it’s crucial to ensure your server has enough space for the shared drive. Here’s how to check:

1. Log into your server.
2. Open Disk Management to view available hard drive space.

### Creating Unallocated Space

If necessary, create unallocated space on your server's C drive, which we will use for the shared drive. Typically, a physically installed drive is preferred, but for this tutorial, we're demonstrating the process in a lab environment.

## Setting Up the Shared Drive

### Creating a New Simple Volume

Now, let’s use the unallocated space to create a new volume:

1. Right-click the unallocated space and select **New Simple Volume**.
2. Follow the wizard to specify the volume size and assign a drive letter.

### Creating a Shared Managed Drive

Next, we'll share the new volume:

1. Right-click the new volume and choose **New Share**.
2. Decide between basic and advanced sharing options, based on your needs.

### Understanding Shared Drive Options

Remember, for redundancy and failover, clustering your servers is beneficial.

### Naming the Shared Drive

Choose a meaningful name for your drive; we'll use it for the finance department in this example.

## Configuring Shared Network Folders

### Specifying the Folder

Create a dedicated folder for the finance department on your shared drive. Avoid spaces in the folder name to simplify scripting tasks.

### Custom Permissions Setup

Ensure administrators have full access rights and finalize the setup of your shared network folders.

## Organizing and Access Control

### Organizing the Shared Drive

Rename your drive for clarity and create additional folders for different departments as needed, such as HR and marketing. Implement automated backups using Shadow Copy and establish access controls through Active Directory.

### Access Control Management

Use Active Directory (AD) for detailed access management. You'll need AD to change, grant, or remove access as required.

### Granting Access to the Finance Department

Ensure that the finance department has access only to their specific folder, setting appropriate permissions.

### Adding Users to the Finance Group

Demonstrate the addition of users to the finance group in AD, granting them access to the necessary folders.

## Technical Implementation

### Mapping a Network Drive

Manually or using PowerShell, map the network drive for users. This ensures they can access the shared folder efficiently.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

This tutorial has guided you through the setup and management of a shared network drive. In our next video, we'll create a PowerShell script to automate network drive mapping for specific user groups.
